## 🔮 Self-Programmable Reality

This is the core feature that sets PowerMatrixRain apart. You don't just watch the rain; **you define it**.

The matrix stream is powered by `words.toml`. This file is your interface to the simulation.
- Want to manifest abundance? **Program it.**
- Want to visualize code concepts? **Program it.**
- Want to immerse yourself in poetry? **Program it.**

### How to Program Your Rain:
1. Open `words.toml` in any text editor.
2. Add your words, phrases, or affirmations to the list.
3. Run the rain and watch your inputs materialize into digital existence.

```toml
words = [
    "ABUNDANCE", "CLARITY", "FOCUS",
    "RUST", "WGPU", "POWER",
    "YOUR_DREAMS_HERE"
]
```
